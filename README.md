# PDF_Data_Summarizer
## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a Streamlit web application that allows users to upload PDF files, extract text content from them, and generate a summarized version of the extracted text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Problem Statement

In the digital age, large volumes of information are stored in PDF documents. Manually reading and summarizing these documents can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. This project aims to simplify this process by providing an automated solution to extract and summarize text from PDF files.
